# Your_own_Terence_Tao
An interactive website for students to learn intermediate mathematics in a fun, engaging manner - it's so good it'll be as if Terence Tao was teaching you! (ok, maybe it's not that good but you get the idea)

This is a personal project for me to familiarize myself with some standard web development technology (React, CSS, HTML, etc.) and have the chance to design a beautiful interface
